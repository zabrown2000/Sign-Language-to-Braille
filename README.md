This is our project, from the Lev-Tech Annual Hackathon for Women, May 2022.
We created a neural-network model to scan in hand movements and translate them to the corresponding text and then to Braille.
The model was created to subsitute in any sign langauge dialect. Currently the program translates from ASL->English->Braille for English.
