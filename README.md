This is our project, from the Lev-Tech Annual Hackathon for Women, May 2022.
We created a neural-network model to scan in hand movements and translate them to the corresponding text and then to Braille.
The model was created to subsitute in any sign langauge dialect. Currently the program translates from ASL->English->Braille for English.

The foldersCreation file will create the necessary folders for you to store your training and testing images. 
Feel free to add to them however you see fit and how it will best work with the languages you have chosen.
